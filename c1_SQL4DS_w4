module 4 coding questions
1. Pull a list of customer ids with the customer’s full name, and address, along with combining their city and country together. Be sure to make a space in between these two and make it UPPER CASE. (e.g. LOS ANGELES USA)

        select CustomerId,
          FirstName,
          LastName,
          upper(city || " " || Country) as temp_col
        from customers
        
2. Create a new employee user id by combining the first 4 letters of the employee’s first name with the first 2 letters of the employee’s last name. Make the new field lower case and pull each individual step to show your work.
            select lower(substr(firstname,1,4) || substr(LastName,1,2)) as employee_id
            from employees
            
3. Show a list of employees who have worked for the company for 15 or more years using the current date function. Sort by lastname ascending.

      SELECT 	FirstName,
          LastName,
          HireDate,
          (STRFTIME('%Y', 'now'))-
          (STRFTIME('%Y', HireDate)) as years_worked
      FROM EMPLOYEES 
      order by LastName ASC
      
4. Profiling the Customers table, answer the following question. Are there any columns with null values? Indicate any below. Select all that apply.

5. Find the cities with the most customers and rank in descending order.
	select city, count(city) from customers 
	group by city
	order by count(city) DESC
	
6. Create a new customer invoice id by combining a customer’s invoice id with their first and last name while ordering your query in the following order: firstname, lastname, and invoiceID.

			select i.InvoiceId , c.FirstName ,c.LastName , c.FirstName || c.LastName || i.InvoiceId as New_InvoiceID
			FROM customers c
			left join invoices i
			on c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId 
			where c.LastName = "Gruber"
