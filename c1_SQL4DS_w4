module 4 coding questions
1. Pull a list of customer ids with the customer’s full name, and address, along with combining their city and country together. Be sure to make a space in between these two and make it UPPER CASE. (e.g. LOS ANGELES USA)

        select CustomerId,
          FirstName,
          LastName,
          upper(city || " " || Country) as temp_col
        from customers
        
2. Create a new employee user id by combining the first 4 letters of the employee’s first name with the first 2 letters of the employee’s last name. Make the new field lower case and pull each individual step to show your work.
            select lower(substr(firstname,1,4) || substr(LastName,1,2)) as employee_id
            from employees
            
3. Show a list of employees who have worked for the company for 15 or more years using the current date function. Sort by lastname ascending.

      SELECT 	FirstName,
          LastName,
          HireDate,
          (STRFTIME('%Y', 'now'))-
          (STRFTIME('%Y', HireDate)) as years_worked
      FROM EMPLOYEES 
      order by LastName ASC
