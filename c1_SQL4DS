          SELECT albums.title, count(artists.name) FROM tracks
          left join albums
          on tracks.AlbumId = albums.AlbumId
          left join invoice_items
          on tracks.TrackId = invoice_items.TrackId
          left join artists
          on albums.ArtistId = artists.ArtistId
          where artists.name = "Audioslave"

3. Find the first and last name of any customer who does not have an invoice. Are there any customers returned from the query?

          on t.TrackId = i.TrackId
          left join albums a
          on t.AlbumId = a.AlbumId
          where i.unitprice is not null
          group by t.albumid
          having a.title="Big Ones"

5. How many records are created when you apply a Cartesian join to the invoice and invoice items table?
