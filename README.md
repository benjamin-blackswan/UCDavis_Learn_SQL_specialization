# UCDavis_Learn_SQL_specialization

Hi, welcome to my first repository.

Here I will upload my codes and notes for the UC Davis Learn SQL specialization on Coursera.

I use Dbeaver throughout the course.

Dbeaver is a SQL GUI client that is able to handle SQLite, which is used in this specialization.


Thanks for reading

Ben.
